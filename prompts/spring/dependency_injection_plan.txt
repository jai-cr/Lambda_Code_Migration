You are planning dependency injection for migrated code.

INPUT:
- Java classes
- Constructors
- AWS clients
- Static utility usage

TASK:
Define how dependencies should be injected in Spring.

OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
{
  "beans": [
    {
      "type": "Service | Repository | Client | Config",
      "class": "ClassName",
      "scope": "singleton | prototype",
      "injection": "constructor",
      "notes": "special considerations"
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- Eliminate static access
- No manual instantiation
